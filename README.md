# ABOUT

Here is a lib which I wrote for some lastmile delivery robot project

## Keywords

MCP4725, Adafruit, Raspberry pi3, RUIZHI DC10-55V 60A Stepless Speed Controller

## Before start use the lib first do following steps

install following tools:

    sudo apt-get install python-smbus
    sudo apt-get install i2c-tools

check your i2c device is connected

    sudo i2cdetect -y 0

if all is fine you can run tests to check lib and then start use it in your own way.\
Good luck :)!
